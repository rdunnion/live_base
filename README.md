# live_base

This is my capstone project for a BS in Software Development at Champlain College, Burlington VT.

The basic design is a webpage that records user entered information about live music thay have collected. 
It can be then searched and provide the results online.

The front end is HTML/CSS.

The back end is PHP.

The database is MySQL.

There is user authentication that records the password as a hash.
