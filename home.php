            <h3>About Live Base</h3>
            <p>Live Base is a project to allow live music collectors to store information about thier<br>
                collections in a database. The database entries can be searched by every registered user.<br>
                The users passwords are protected by hashing the users passwords prior to storing<br>
                them in the database. This protects the passwords from being viewed in plain text.<br>
            </p>
